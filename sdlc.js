/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis = "The second step in SDLC that determines what the application is meant to do, as well as what it requires. It also defines the required resources a developer needs."

const design = "The third step; it models how a software will function like security, programming, and a user interface. Prototyping is also a part of design that gets the basics down."

const implementation = "The fourth step; this is when development actually begins, and developers follow a set of guidelines to write code."

const testing = "This is the fifth step, which is where issues are detected, reported, and fixed to make sure it fits quality standards."

const maintain = "The final step in SDLC, which means that the software can be released and enhanced based on any feedback."
